## Overview

In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) research has undergone a massive transformation. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has dramatically improved the ability to generate and understand text, revolutionizing various application domains such as translation, question answering, and summarization. In 2024-2025, multimodal LLMs like GPT-5 and **Gemini 2.5 Pro** that can simultaneously process text, images, and audio have emerged, further expanding the scope of applications. Particularly noteworthy is the emergence of new architectures beyond **Transformer**. For example, **Mamba**, a state space model (SSM), can efficiently process up to millions of tokens with linear O(n) complexity, while **RWKV** can process conversational messages at 10x or more lower cost than existing methods in real-time.

This course reflects these latest developments to provide **hands-on** deep learning-based NLP techniques. Students first learn **core tool utilization methods** such as PyTorch and Hugging Face usage, then directly experience fine-tuning of **Transformer-based models and latest SSM architectures**, **prompt engineering**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)**, and **agent framework** implementation. Additionally, we cover latest **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** techniques (WaveFT, DoRA, VB-LoRA, etc.) and advanced **RAG architectures** (HippoRAG, GraphRAG), and practice cutting-edge concepts such as **multimodal LLMs** and **ultra-long context processing**. Finally, through team projects, students integrate learned content to implement **complete models and applications** that solve real problems.

This course is designed for third-year undergraduate level and assumes completion of prerequisite course _Language Models and Natural Language Processing (131107967A)_. Through team projects, students challenge real problem-solving using Korean corpora, and in the final project phase, we provide opportunities to work with industry datasets and receive feedback from industry experts, considering **industry-academia collaboration**.
