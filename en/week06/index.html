<h1>Week 6: Advances in Multimodal NLP<a class="headerlink" href="#week-6-advances-in-multimodal-nlp" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This lecture examines <strong>the latest developments in multimodal NLP</strong> based on cutting-edge papers and model architectures as of 2025. We particularly focus on the concept of <strong>“Any-to-Any”</strong> multimodal models, latest speech technologies, and practical applications utilizing these technologies.</p>

<h2>1. “Any-to-Any” Multimodal Models<a class="headerlink" href="#any-to-any-multimodal-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>“Any-to-Any” multimodal models refer to <strong>universal models</strong> that can receive <strong>various types of inputs</strong> (modalities) and <strong>generate diverse forms of outputs</strong>. For example, if a single model can understand text, images, audio, and video as inputs and generate not only text but also audio or images as responses, it is called an “Any-to-Any” multimodal model. As of 2025, the emergence of these universal multimodal models is transforming the paradigm in the NLP field. In this section, we examine the latest Any-to-Any multimodal models including <strong>SmolVLM2</strong>, <strong>Qwen 2.5 Omni</strong>, <strong>QVQ-72B</strong> (Preview), as well as <strong>OpenAI GPT-5</strong>, <strong>Google Gemini 2.5 Pro</strong>, and <strong>Anthropic Claude 4.1</strong>. We compare the architecture, functionality, performance, limitations, and significance of each model.</p>

<h3>SmolVLM2 (256M–2.2B)<a class="headerlink" href="#smolvlm2-256m2-2b" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>SmolVLM2</strong> is a <strong>lightweight multimodal model</strong> developed by the Hugging Face research team as the <strong>second generation of small vision-language model series</strong>. It is provided in three parameter scales: <strong>256M, 500M, and 2.2B</strong>, and is efficient enough to run on <strong>less than 1GB VRAM</strong>. Even the largest 2.2B model can perform video understanding tasks with only <strong>5.2GB VRAM</strong>, achieving a level where it can operate on <strong>mobile or edge devices</strong>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Architecture</strong>: SmolVLM2 uses a structure composed of an <strong>image encoder</strong> and <strong>text decoder</strong>. Specifically, it consists of an efficient image encoder called <strong>shape-optimized SigLIP</strong> and a lightweight language model decoder called <strong>SmolLM2</strong>. This is a simplified version of the approach used by large-scale VLMs, characterized by reducing the <strong>number of tokens for image input</strong> and adopting efficient tokenization strategies to improve performance even in small models. It is also designed based on the existing multimodal model architecture called <strong>Idefics3</strong>, which has a structure that integrates image and text embeddings to generate text. Simply put, it can be viewed as an optimized form of <strong>Flamingo-style</strong> vision-language combination (image encoder + language generator).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Input/Output and Multimodal Connection</strong>: SmolVLM2 can receive <strong>text, images, multiple images, and video</strong> as <strong>arbitrarily combined sequences</strong>. For example, <strong>videos</strong> are processed as continuous frame sequences, and <strong>multiple images and text</strong> can be input alternately to enable queries like “compare and explain these two.” The output is <strong>always generated as text</strong> (descriptions, captions, answers, etc.). It does not support generating images or videos themselves, but is specialized for VQA, captioning, etc., which generate <strong>text responses to visual information</strong>. The multimodal connection structure works by embedding images/video frames through an encoder, then the text decoder generates text by referencing them through <strong>cross-attention</strong>. SmolVLM2 was trained <strong>only on public data</strong>, using a total of 3.3 million samples from multiple vision-language instruction datasets including LLaVA, VideoChat, etc. Thanks to training on these <strong>multi-modal datasets</strong>, it can answer questions about images and videos or generate descriptions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Performance and Features</strong>: Despite being a small model, it shows <strong>robust performance in complex multimodal tasks</strong>. For example, the <strong>smallest 256M model</strong> achieved higher scores than the 8 billion parameter IDEFICS-80B model in some benchmarks, and the <strong>2.2B model</strong> showed performance comparable to some latest large VLMs that use twice the memory. Particularly in problems involving visual information such as <strong>MathVista, TextVQA, ScienceQA</strong>, it showed significant improvement compared to the first generation SmolVLM, and the <strong>2.2B model achieved 52.1 points</strong> in video understanding benchmarks like MLVU, surpassing previous results. Meanwhile, the <strong>256M model</strong>, although having lower absolute performance, recorded <strong>32.7 points on MV-Bench</strong>, demonstrating decent understanding relative to its parameter count. In summary, SmolVLM2’s achievement is maximizing multimodal performance even in small models through <strong>strategic architecture optimization and efficient token reduction</strong>. This is significant in that it opens up the possibility of <strong>utilizing multimodal AI without large-scale resources</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contribution to Lightweight and Generalization</strong>: Existing large multimodal models (e.g., Flamingo 80B, Idefics 80B, etc.) had excellent performance but required <strong>tens of GB of VRAM</strong>, making deployment difficult. SmolVLM2 broke through these limitations and showed the possibility of <strong>VLMs that can operate on mobile devices</strong>. It is particularly emphasized that the 256M model, while operating on <strong>less than 1GB memory</strong>, achieved results that <strong>surpassed 80B models that were 18 months ahead</strong> at the time of development. This means it has <strong>universal multimodal understanding capabilities while being a lightweight model</strong>. By presenting a small model that can process not only static images but also <strong>videos</strong>, it <strong>significantly expanded the application scope</strong> of multimodal models. For example, it can be deployed on IoT devices or robots for applications such as <strong>real-time video analysis and Q&amp;A</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage Example</strong>: Below is a simple example code that loads the publicly available SmolVLM2 model using HuggingFace Transformers to perform <strong>image-based Q&amp;A</strong> (choose between 256M/2.2B models). Since this model was trained in English, it is recommended to input questions in English as well.</p></li>

<p>In the above code, we load a processor that can handle both images and text simultaneously through AutoProcessor, and load the model with AutoModelForImageTextToText. Then we configure the image and question as a content sequence to input to the model, and generate text answers with model.generate(). By utilizing SmolVLM2 in this way, we can execute various multimodal Q&amp;A tasks such as descriptions, question answering, and comparisons for given images (or video frames) even in <strong>lightweight environments</strong>.</p>

<h3>Qwen 2.5 Omni<a class="headerlink" href="#qwen-2-5-omni" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Qwen 2.5 Omni</strong> is an <strong>end-to-end multimodal AI model</strong> developed by the Qwen team at <strong>Alibaba Cloud</strong>, with detailed information introduced in technical reports and blogs published in early 2025. Centered around a <strong>7B parameter base language model</strong> (Qwen-7B), it can <strong>simultaneously process four modal inputs</strong> of text, images, audio, and video, and <strong>simultaneously stream output</strong> both <strong>text and natural speech</strong>. This is its most distinctive feature. As the name “Omni” suggests, it is essentially a universal model that performs all tasks: <strong>“See, Hear, Talk, and Write”</strong> in one.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Architecture (Thinker–Talker)</strong>: Qwen2.5 Omni adopts a <strong>dual architecture</strong> called <strong>Thinker–Talker</strong>. <strong>Thinker</strong> plays the role of the human brain, processing all modal inputs as a <strong>large language model</strong> (LLM) and <strong>generating text responses</strong>. <strong>Talker</strong> corresponds to the <strong>speaker</strong>, receiving Thinker’s hidden representations and <strong>simultaneously generating speech audio tokens</strong> through a <strong>dual-track</strong> (decode dual-track) <strong>Transformer decoder</strong>. Simply put, it’s a structure that extends one large LM into two output streams (text and audio). The two modules are <strong>jointly trained end-to-end</strong> and operate simultaneously during inference, with special design to prevent mutual interference. Thanks to this configuration, the model can <strong>generate sentences while simultaneously synthesizing the speech for those sentences</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Streaming Multimodal Input Processing</strong>: Qwen2.5 Omni was designed with <strong>streaming input</strong> in mind. Audio and video inputs are processed in small <strong>chunk-wise blocks</strong> and fed sequentially to Thinker. In particular, a <strong>time-aligned positional encoding</strong> technique called <strong>TMRoPE</strong> (Time-aligned Multimodal Rotary Positional Embedding) was proposed to combine video frames and audio chunks into <strong>time-axis interleaved sequences</strong> while maintaining their positional information without misalignment. For example, if there are 5 seconds of video and audio, they are combined into one sequence alternating every 0.5 seconds, but time alignment is maintained through RoPE-based positional embeddings. This enables understanding of both audio and video flows simultaneously even in <strong>real-time multimodal conversations</strong>. Text input is also included in the same sequence, and for static <strong>images</strong>, fixed-length vision encoder output is inserted at the beginning of the sequence. The model internally combines <strong>Vision Encoder</strong> and <strong>Audio Encoder</strong> to convert image pixels and audio signals into latent representations, then construct an integrated token sequence that goes into Thinker.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Qwen2.5-Omni's Schematic Structure" src="../_images/qwen25-omni.jpeg" />
<em>Qwen2.5-Omni’s Schematic Structure</em>: Vision Encoder and Audio Encoder embed <strong>visual input</strong> and <strong>audio input</strong> and pass them to Thinker (LLM), while Thinker generates <strong>text responses</strong> and simultaneously the Talker module uses Thinker’s representations to generate <strong>audio responses</strong> (speech) in real-time. This enables <em>simultaneous</em> reading, thinking, and speaking for text, image, audio, and video inputs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Output and Multimodal Connection</strong>: This model’s output is uniquely <strong>both text and speech</strong>. For example, if a user asks a question with voice and also provides an image, the model generates a text answer through Thinker while simultaneously reading that answer aloud through Talker. Particularly, <strong>streaming output</strong> is possible, so as soon as a few characters of text are generated for a sentence, the speech for that part is also generated, implementing <strong>real-time conversation without delay</strong>. Multimodal mode switching is naturally performed by the model itself, operating through special tokens like &lt;Audio&gt; within a sequence to insert speech output (while the internal implementation is complex, conceptually there are “speaking switch” command tokens). <strong>Video output or image generation</strong> functionality is not available in Qwen2.5 Omni, and the output modality is focused on text and speech.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Performance</strong>: Qwen2.5 Omni showed <strong>comprehensive performance that surpasses single-modal models of the same size</strong>. For example, it recorded higher scores than <strong>Qwen2-Audio</strong> (audio-only model) of the same 7B model size in speech recognition and understanding benchmarks, and showed nearly equivalent visual understanding performance to <strong>Qwen2.5-VL-7B</strong> (vision-language model). This means that <strong>multimodal integrated learning</strong> created information synergy compared to individual learning. Also, there was almost no performance degradation for <strong>audio input compared to text input</strong>, and it was reported that <strong>audio Q&amp;A performance was equivalent to text Q&amp;A</strong> in academic benchmarks like MMLU, GSM8K. This suggests that users can get <strong>GPT-4 level knowledge responses even when asking questions with voice</strong>. Meanwhile, it achieved <strong>best performance in the same parameter class</strong> in multimodal comprehensive evaluation metrics like <strong>Omni-Bench</strong>, and is evaluated as one of the <strong>most outstanding public multimodal chatbots</strong> as of 2025. The speech output quality is also excellent, showing <strong>naturalness and stability that surpasses most existing streaming/non-streaming TTS</strong> by streaming TTS standards. That is, the speech generated through Talker was fluent like a human without noise or distortion, and <strong>continuous synthesis</strong> without interruption in the middle of sentences was possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contributions</strong>: The emergence of Qwen2.5 Omni is evaluated as opening the possibility of <strong>truly integrated multimodal AI</strong>. Previously, image+text models, audio+text models, etc. existed individually, but <strong>integrating all input/output modalities into a single model</strong> is an important milestone in this field. In particular, the <strong>Thinker–Talker structure</strong> is a new approach that simultaneously processes text generation and speech generation in one flow, greatly improving the <strong>response delay problem</strong> in multimodal conversation systems. Additionally, Qwen2.5 Omni also paid attention to <strong>lightweighting and practicalization</strong>, and released optimization that <strong>reduces VRAM usage to less than half</strong> through <strong>4-bit quantization</strong> (AWQ) of model weights and module-wise loading/offloading. As a result, this large multimodal model can be run even on RTX 3080 (10GB) class GPUs, approaching a level where it can be deployed not only for research purposes but also for <strong>actual application services</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage Examples and Open Source</strong>: Qwen2.5 Omni’s model and training code are publicly available on Alibaba’s GitHub (QwenLM), and 4-bit quantized intermediate weights are also provided on Hugging Face. However, since the model structure is complex, an extended version of the Transformers library must be installed, and input processing must be done using the provided <strong>qwen-omni-utils</strong> toolkit. Through the provided example scripts, demos can be run that recognize microphone input audio in real-time and stream output text and speech responses. For example, running the low_VRAM_demo_awq.py script allows experiencing a chat that receives <strong>camera video + microphone audio</strong> as input and performs text responses on screen along with speech output through speakers. Through these public demos, interesting use cases are confirmed such as <strong>conversing with others like video calls, or having the model explain music characteristics when music is played</strong>. (Qwen2.5 Omni was mainly trained on Chinese and English data, fluently supporting these two languages, while other languages are limited.)</p></li>

<h3>QVQ-72B (Preview → QVQ-Max)<a class="headerlink" href="#qvq-72b-preview-qvq-max" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>QVQ-72B</strong> is a <strong>super-large visual reasoning</strong> (multimodal reasoning) <strong>model</strong> released as a <strong>preview version</strong> by the Alibaba Qwen team in late 2024. As the name suggests, it is a <strong>72 billion parameter</strong> (72B) scale model, and is an experimental model that greatly enhanced <strong>visual reasoning capabilities</strong> based on <strong>Qwen2-VL-72B</strong> (72B vision-language model) from the Qwen series. It was introduced as being developed with the goal of <strong>solving complex problems step by step by looking at images</strong> like humans. In December 2024, <strong>weights were made public</strong> (downloadable open-weight), attracting attention as the <strong>first super-large visual reasoning model</strong> that general researchers could download and use.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Architecture and Multimodal Connection</strong>: QVQ-72B was fine-tuned based on the existing large model <strong>Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct</strong>. The basic structure is a <strong>text-generating Transformer LM</strong> with a <strong>vision encoder for image input</strong> attached. The vision encoder uses a large ViT model from the CLIP family, and the output image embeddings are inserted into the text token sequence so that the language model can process them. Meanwhile, QVQ adopted a training strategy that emphasizes <strong>“Think with evidence”</strong>, that is, <strong>thinking with evidence</strong>. When solving complex visual problems, it was fine-tuned to generate step-by-step explanations through <strong>Chain-of-Thought</strong> (sequential reasoning), showing a tendency to <strong>unfold intermediate thinking processes in text</strong> rather than giving answers immediately. This aimed to improve performance in mathematics/science areas with many multi-step reasoning problems. In the preview version, some limitations that appeared in this process (e.g., self-repetition or forgetting image information) were pointed out, but the fundamental idea showed the foundation for future <strong>multimodal CoT</strong>. As input, <strong>one or multiple images + text</strong> can be provided together, and the output is <strong>string-form answers and explanations</strong>. For example, if asked to “look at the following physics problem and explain the solution process,” it recognizes the image and generates step-by-step solution processes and final answers all at once.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Performance</strong>: QVQ-72B (Preview) showed achievements that greatly surpassed previous models in <strong>visual reasoning capabilities</strong>. It recorded <strong>70.3 points</strong> on the <strong>MMMU benchmark</strong>, a comprehensive multimodal test at the university level, which was a significant improvement over the 64.5 points of the existing model (Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct) of the same 72B size, and approached the performance of OpenAI’s private model (OpenAI o1) in some questions. Particularly in <strong>visual+logical complex problems</strong> such as mathematical graphs and formulas (MathVista, etc.), it showed <strong>5-10 points or more improvement</strong> compared to the previous generation, and also reduced the SOTA gap with good performance in high-difficulty problem sets like <strong>MathVision</strong> and <strong>OlympiadBench</strong> (science olympiad problems). For example, while Qwen2-VL scored only 11.2 points on OlympiadBench, QVQ-72B nearly doubled to 20.4 points, approaching OpenAI o1 (25.9 points). These improvements prove the effectiveness of <strong>training specialized for solving complex problems using images</strong>. In summary, QVQ is evaluated as a model that elevated AI’s <strong>visual reasoning capabilities</strong> by one level under the motto of <strong>“See the world through images (See)”</strong>, <strong>“Contemplate through language (Think)”</strong>, and <strong>“Present conclusions through language (Answer)”</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update: QVQ-Max Release</strong> – In March 2025, <strong>QVQ-Max</strong>, the successor version of QVQ-72B preview, was <strong>officially released</strong>. QVQ-Max complements the limitations of its predecessor, supporting <strong>simultaneous analysis of multiple images</strong>, <strong>video clip understanding</strong>, <strong>improved step-by-step reasoning</strong>, etc. For example, it can be used to compare and analyze multiple images or continuously interpret scenes in videos to answer questions. QVQ-Max showed <strong>improvements in accuracy and functionality</strong> compared to the preview, and through this, the Qwen team showed the possibility of <strong>“Think with evidence”</strong> AI closer to reality. In <strong>high-difficulty multimodal problems</strong> like MMMU and MathVision, QVQ-Max achieved higher accuracy than the previous preview, and demonstration results also revealed <strong>transparent “thinking” processes that reason through multiple images step by step</strong>. Although it’s still the first version, it is evaluated as laying the foundation for the future <strong>practicalization of visual CoT reasoning</strong>. (Note: In the second half of 2025, <strong>Qwen3-Max</strong> of the next generation of the Qwen series appeared with 1 trillion parameters, which is a case of further expanding the boundaries of multimodal AI. However, this lecture covers up to the Qwen2.5 generation.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitations and Future Improvements</strong>: Several limitations were reported in the preview stage of QVQ-72B. There were issues with <strong>language mixing</strong> where languages were occasionally mixed in responses (e.g., Chinese sentences inserted in English responses), and cases where <strong>recursive reasoning</strong> would go in circles without reaching conclusions and repeat verbosely. Also pointed out were insufficient safety measures and the possibility of <strong>gradually forgetting image context and producing nonsense</strong> during multi-step reasoning. The team announced that they had largely resolved these problems by releasing the <strong>QVQ-Max</strong> version that improved these issues. Nevertheless, the significance of QVQ-72B preview is great. By <strong>making super-large multimodal models public</strong>, it allowed researchers to experiment directly, and it presented new benchmarks and evaluation methods that combine <strong>image+text+reasoning</strong>. For example, datasets like MMMU and MathVista where QVQ achieved high scores became <strong>new standards for evaluating visual thinking abilities</strong> and became targets for other models thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Usage and Applications</strong>: QVQ-72B is difficult to handle directly in general GPU environments due to its very large model size, but <em>Preview</em> weights are available on Hugging Face (downloadable after approval). Also, through <a class="reference external" href="http://Qwen.ai">Qwen.ai</a>’s demo, <strong>online testing</strong> can be experienced by uploading simple images and asking questions. In terms of applications, models like QVQ can be deployed for tasks that require humans to use both images and language together, such as <strong>scientific problem solving, data visualization interpretation, and geometric reasoning</strong>. For example, there is high potential for use in specialized knowledge fields such as <strong>understanding and explaining paper figures</strong> or <strong>reading and interpreting complex mathematical graphs</strong>. Although it’s still difficult to trust model outputs at the preview stage, these <strong>high-dimensional visual+language reasoning agents</strong> are gradually becoming reality through the emergence of improved versions like QVQ-Max.</p></li>

<h3>OpenAI GPT-5<a class="headerlink" href="#openai-gpt-5" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>GPT-5</strong> is a <strong>next-generation multimodal large language model</strong> (LLM) announced by OpenAI in August 2025. This model, which appeared about a year and a half after GPT-4, is evaluated as having achieved <strong>dramatic improvements in all aspects compared to the previous generation</strong>. GPT-5 shows <strong>SOTA performance in various fields including coding, mathematics, writing, visual understanding, and medical consultation</strong>, and is said to have demonstrated <strong>human-level or higher task performance capabilities</strong> in OpenAI’s internal evaluations. In particular, GPT-5’s biggest change is that it is an <strong>integrated system</strong> that internalizes <strong>“thinking capabilities”</strong>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Architecture (Unified Thinking System)</strong>: GPT-5 is, in short, <strong>not a single model, but an integrated system</strong>. Internally, it is known to have a structure that combines two-stage models (lightweight model for fast responses + deep reasoning model) and a <strong>real-time router</strong>. Basically, a lightweight model responds immediately to simple questions, and when there are difficult problems or requests to “think carefully,” it switches to <strong>advanced reasoning mode</strong> (GPT-5 Thinking) to calculate more deeply. This structure achieves efficiency by <strong>dynamically selecting models</strong> according to user queries, responding quickly and at low cost for everyday conversations while investing sufficient computation for complex problems. OpenAI developed <strong>technology to combine large and small language models into one product</strong> for this purpose, and gradually optimized it by reflecting user feedback (model switching frequency, response preferences, etc.) in router training. In the case of the GPT-5 Pro version, more usage of this <strong>deep reasoning mode</strong> is allowed, enabling more <strong>accurate and comprehensive responses</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multimodal Input and Understanding</strong>: GPT-5 has greatly improved understanding of <strong>non-text inputs</strong> (unstructured data) compared to GPT-4. While GPT-4 already had some image interpretation capabilities, GPT-5 can analyze <strong>images, diagrams, charts, and even short video clips</strong> and perform reasoning from them. For example, when given a chart image and asked for a summary, it reads and explains more accurately than GPT-4, and when presentation slide photos are input, its ability to summarize content or answer questions has improved. It also shows strengths compared to GPT-4 in <strong>spatial reasoning</strong> (e.g., geometric problems) or <strong>physical video understanding</strong>, recording a high score of 84.2% on multimodal comprehensive benchmarks like <strong>MMMU</strong>. However, GPT-5 itself remains limited to <strong>text output modality</strong>. (OpenAI’s speech output functionality is provided through a separate TTS engine, and image generation is performed through tools like DALL-E.) Nevertheless, GPT-5 has greatly increased <strong>reasoning accuracy for image inputs</strong> and has the ability to <strong>understand meaning in continuous frames</strong> even in video-based queries, taking one step closer to <strong>intelligence that integrates non-verbal information to provide answers</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Reasoning and Precision</strong>: GPT-5 has strengthened its <strong>chain-of-thought</strong> <strong>utilization capabilities</strong> compared to GPT-4. While GPT-4 could also think step by step when given CoT prompts, GPT-5 is said to <strong>automatically activate internal “thinking mode”</strong> in complex problems even without separate prompts, finding more accurate answers through multiple steps. As a result, it showed achievements that greatly surpassed GPT-4 in mathematics, logic, and science problems. For example, it recorded a new SOTA of <strong>88.4%</strong> on the <strong>GPQA</strong> (General Problem-solving &amp; Question Answering) benchmark, and also achieved 18.8% accuracy on the <strong>AIME 2025</strong> medical exam without tools, breaking existing records. Additionally, GPT-5 has improved <strong>fact verification and reflection capabilities</strong>, with <strong>hallucination occurrence rates</strong> dropping to less than half compared to GPT-4, and increased frequency of <strong>honestly admitting what it doesn’t know</strong>. In particular, the problem of <strong>making false guesses about visual information-based questions</strong> has been improved, with GPT-4(o3) arbitrarily interpreting non-existent images at 86.7% on the CharXiv image-text combination benchmark, while GPT-5 was only 9%. These improvements show that GPT-5 has advanced in <strong>honesty</strong> and <strong>reliability</strong> by knowing how to answer <strong>“I don’t know if I don’t know”</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Performance and Features</strong>: GPT-5 showed <strong>top-level performance in all fields</strong> as of its release. In coding capabilities, it showed <strong>significant improvement over GPT-4</strong>, producing excellent results in frontend webpage generation and large-scale codebase debugging. Examples have been released of creating <strong>complete web apps</strong> with a single prompt or generating code that reflects <strong>UI design sensibilities</strong>. In writing, it can generate <strong>more creative and literary texts</strong> than GPT-4, with improved ability to maintain <strong>consistent writing style</strong> in poetry, essays, etc. In specialized areas, it recorded <strong>HealthBench</strong> scores that surpassed GPT-4 in medical Q&amp;A, providing <strong>more accurate and thoughtful responses</strong> when giving medical information to users. Despite these enhanced capabilities, OpenAI integrated GPT-5 into the <strong>ChatGPT</strong> interface and began providing it to Plus users so that anyone can use it. Plus users can use the GPT-5 model as default, but can utilize <strong>GPT-5 Pro</strong> mode (deep reasoning) within limited usage. In summary, GPT-5 has established itself as the current strongest LLM that <strong>adjusts response speed and depth according to the situation</strong>, <strong>understands more diverse inputs</strong>, and generates <strong>high-factuality responses</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contributions and Limitations</strong>: GPT-5 opened new horizons for LLMs, but at the same time there are challenges due to <strong>increased model complexity</strong>. Since it’s a system that integrates multiple sub-models and routers, significant effort is required for development and maintenance, and it’s difficult for general developers to imitate the same approach. Also, GPT-5 has not yet reached the stage of <strong>generating all vision-language-speech outputs from a single model</strong>. For example, it cannot <strong>directly output speech</strong> like Qwen2.5 Omni, and image generation is also not integrated. This appears to be a result of OpenAI choosing modularization for <strong>model safety and expertise</strong>, and attention is being paid to whether integration will be achieved in future versions like GPT-6. Nevertheless, GPT-5’s contributions in <strong>multimodal understanding, chain-of-thought reasoning, and factuality improvement</strong> have greatly contributed to the <strong>practicality enhancement</strong> of large models. In fact, after GPT-5’s announcement, cases of <strong>expert-level task automation</strong> were reported in various industrial fields, showing that the era when AI performs various tasks at human level is rapidly approaching.</p></li>

<h3>Google Gemini 2.5 Pro<a class="headerlink" href="#google-gemini-2-5-pro" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Gemini 2.5 Pro</strong> is a <strong>next-generation multimodal AI model</strong> released by Google DeepMind in March 2025, which became a hot topic for its <strong>comprehensive intelligence that surpasses GPT-4</strong>. Gemini was originally a multimodal model announced in 2024, and the <strong>2.5 version</strong> was released in 2025 with major upgrades. It features <strong>Native Multimodality</strong> (native multimodal support), <strong>1 million token (context) length</strong> context processing, and <strong>advanced reasoning (Thinking) capabilities</strong>. As the name suggests, Gemini (twin constellation) is a model family that combines <strong>two elements</strong> – <em>basic language model</em> and <em>reasoning capabilities</em> – and 2.5 Pro is the <strong>most powerful version</strong> among them.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Architecture and “Thinking” Internalization</strong>: According to Google, Gemini 2.5 is classified as a <strong>thinking model</strong>. This means that the model <strong>internally develops its own thinking process</strong> before answering questions to produce more accurate results. This functionality is implemented through a technique called <strong>“Flash Thinking”</strong>, which was introduced in version 2.0 and further improved in 2.5. Although the specific architecture is not disclosed, it is known to <strong>vary computation according to task difficulty</strong> through methods such as <strong>additional token issuance for reasoning</strong> or <strong>self-allocation of computational budget</strong>. It also supports <strong>ultra-large context</strong> (up to 1 million tokens), enabling <strong>comprehensive analysis</strong> by inputting long documents or complex datasets into the model at once. For example, if you input a hundreds-page report along with related images, tables, etc. at once and make a query, Gemini 2.5 can generate answers by referencing all of them. This <strong>massive context + self-reasoning</strong> combination is a unique strength of Gemini that has no precedent in any other model currently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Input and Multimodal Processing</strong>: Gemini 2.5 is designed to <strong>natively</strong> understand various inputs including <strong>text, images, audio (speech), video, and code</strong>. “Native” means that the model itself processes this information without separate tools. In fact, the development team stated that Gemini 2.5 has improved <strong>speech recognition accuracy</strong> over Whisper and enhanced <strong>image understanding capabilities</strong>. From the user’s perspective, they can interact simply by <strong>asking questions with voice or showing images</strong>, just like having a conversation with a human. For example, if you ask “(voice) What kind of bird is in this photo?”, Gemini converts the voice to text and analyzes the image to answer the bird species. Since all these processes occur <strong>within the end-to-end model</strong>, response speed and accuracy are excellent. <strong>Output modality</strong> is basically text, but Google has provided a pilot <strong>Flash (Image)</strong> feature that links Gemini with <strong>generative models like Imagen</strong> to enable <strong>image generation responses</strong>. Through this, if you ask Gemini to “draw a picture describing the scene,” Gemini internally understands the request and can generate an image through Imagen to return the result. (This feature is limitedly released as Vertex AI’s Flash Image Preview.) While speech output is not yet provided by default, <strong>text↔speech conversation</strong> is also possible by integrating Gemini with Google Assistant and connecting it to a TTS engine. In summary, Gemini 2.5 can be said to be a model that has almost realized <strong>Any-to-Any at the input stage</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Performance</strong>: Gemini 2.5 Pro swept <strong>first place</strong> in multiple benchmarks upon its appearance. It recorded first place by defeating GPT-4 and others by a large margin in <strong>LMArena</strong>, a comprehensive evaluation based on human preferences, and achieved SOTA scores in <strong>mathematics and science problems</strong> (AIME 2025, etc.) without prior voting (majority voting). It also scored 18.8% on <strong>Humanity’s Last Exam</strong>, a difficult knowledge test, taking first place (among models without tools). <strong>Coding performance</strong> also improved dramatically compared to 2.0, recording <strong>63.8%</strong> on <strong>SWE-Bench Verified</strong>, a representative agent coding evaluation. This is a result that surpasses contemporary models like OpenAI GPT-4.5 or Anthropic Claude 3.7. Overall, Gemini 2.5 excels in <strong>the ability to integrate heterogeneous information sources to solve complex problems</strong>, with strengths in <strong>code, reasoning, and science</strong> areas. Google emphasized that Gemini 2.5 generates <strong>“high-quality style responses”</strong>, meaning it excels not only in getting correct answers but also in <strong>sentence expressiveness and sophistication</strong>. In actual user reviews, many cases highly evaluate Gemini responses’ <strong>writing style or explanation friendliness</strong> compared to GPT-4.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Significance and Accessibility</strong>: Gemini 2.5 can be said to be a culmination that <strong>comprehensively integrates and fuses multimodal technologies</strong> (e.g., image models, speech models, translation, etc.) that Google has accumulated over a long period. This model has laid the foundation for AI to act by considering <strong>massive knowledge bases + complex environments</strong> at once by processing both <strong>1M token context</strong> and <strong>multi-modal inputs</strong>. For example, it has become possible to perform tasks that require <strong>long-term context understanding and visual information combination</strong> with a single model, such as reading hundreds of pages of documents while simultaneously analyzing related figures and tables for Q&amp;A. This is expected to bring great innovation to future <strong>specialized domains</strong> (legal document review, research paper analysis, etc.) or <strong>conversational agent</strong> (user guide AI) development. Google provides Gemini 2.5 Pro as an API through the <strong>Vertex AI platform</strong>, and has made it available for developers and users to test directly on <strong>Google AI Studio</strong> and <strong>Gemini app</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="http://gemini.google.com">gemini.google.com</a>). Pricing policies have also been disclosed to prepare for enterprises to use it scalably. However, Gemini 2.5’s own model weights are not disclosed, and specific parameter counts or training data remain confidential. Nevertheless, Gemini 2.5’s release has also stimulated the <strong>open ecosystem</strong>, becoming an opportunity for the competitive landscape of large LLMs to rapidly evolve toward <strong>multimodal+ultra-long context+high-dimensional reasoning</strong>.</p></li>

<h3>Anthropic Claude 4.1<a class="headerlink" href="#anthropic-claude-4-1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Claude 4</strong> is a <strong>latest generation LLM</strong> announced by Anthropic in mid-2025, showing excellent performance particularly in <strong>coding and agentic tasks</strong>. Claude 4 is internally provided as <strong>two models</strong>: <strong>Claude Opus 4</strong> and <strong>Claude Sonnet 4</strong>. Opus 4 is a high-performance mode, and Sonnet 4 is a lightweight/fast mode, adopting a structure that separates <strong>fast response and deep reasoning</strong> similar to OpenAI’s GPT-5. <strong>Claude 4.1</strong> is a minor upgrade version of Opus 4 released in August 2025, with improvements in <strong>multi-file coding, agent reasoning, and detailed search capabilities</strong>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Model Configuration and “Extended Thinking”</strong>: The Claude 4 series is called a <strong>hybrid model</strong>. This is an approach that switches between <strong>immediate response mode</strong> and <strong>extended thinking mode</strong> according to user requests to produce optimal results. Claude Opus 4 is designed to proceed with <strong>continuous work over several hours</strong> without interruption, enabling it to persistently solve problems requiring thousands of steps. For example, there are reports that Opus 4 independently performed code refactoring for over 7 hours while maintaining steady performance. The key to making this possible is <strong>extended context memory and tool usage</strong>. Claude 4 models can handle <strong>100K+ token contexts</strong> (Claude 2 already had 100K), and when developers allow file access, they can create <strong>local memory files</strong> to store/reference necessary information. Additionally, <strong>tool usage capabilities</strong> have been greatly enhanced, enabling parallel use of tools like web search or code execution, and <strong>self-planning</strong> and execution even in multi-step tasks. Anthropic introduced a <strong>“thinking summary”</strong> feature for this purpose, where a small model summarizes intermediate thoughts when reasoning steps become too long. Through these mechanisms, Claude 4 shows <strong>sufficient self-reasoning for most problems but summarizes only when necessary</strong> to maintain efficiency. In summary, Claude 4 is a model that has evolved to be suitable for <strong>large-scale multi-step tasks</strong> by technically solving the <strong>long-term reasoning stability</strong> problem of LLMs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Agent and Coding Specialization</strong>: The point emphasized during Claude 4’s announcement was <strong>top performance in the coding field</strong>. In particular, Opus 4 recorded first place with <strong>72.5%</strong> on SWE-Bench (large-scale software engineering tasks) and also led with 43.2% on Terminal-Bench (terminal task execution). This is a result that surpasses scores of GPT-4 and others. Claude is strong in <strong>complex multi-file code modification and refactoring</strong>, with developer feedback that it achieves <strong>accurate modifications with minimal bugs</strong>. Sonnet 4 also shows excellent performance with 72.7% on SWE-Bench despite being a small model, and GitHub announced that it will utilize this for next-generation Copilot agents. Additionally, Claude 4 excels in <strong>Agentic tasks</strong> – for example, <strong>achieving goals using external tools</strong>. Anthropic provided tools like <strong>web browser and file editing</strong> as APIs along with Claude 4’s release, and Claude successfully solved complex problems by using them in parallel. For example, Claude 4 autonomously handled tasks by utilizing <strong>multiple tools in one scenario</strong>, such as finding information from the web according to given rules, recording it in local files, and executing terminal commands when necessary. These capabilities have been immediately applied to <strong>enterprise AI assistant</strong> or <strong>automation agent</strong> development, and MS Copilot Studio and others are also integrating Claude 4 for various workflows.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multimodal Elements</strong>: Anthropic Claude 4 was mainly released as a <strong>text-based</strong> model, but internal evaluations also included <strong>multimodal learning</strong> metrics like <strong>MMMLU, MMMU</strong>. This suggests that Claude can <strong>process images, etc. through tools</strong>. In actual Claude 4 Extended Thinking mode, it is said to have performed functions like chart understanding or text extraction from images by linking <strong>image captioning models</strong> or <strong>OCR</strong>. For example, if you ask Claude 4 to “analyze the attached chart,” Claude calls a pre-given image description API to get the content and reasons based on that text. This <strong>modular multimodal processing</strong> is a similar approach to the GPT-4 Plugin system, enabling Claude to <strong>utilize visual information by cooperating with external tools</strong> even though Claude itself cannot understand image vectors. Therefore, while Claude 4 is not <strong>native multimodal integration</strong> like Qwen or GPT-5, it can be viewed as supporting <strong>multimodal problem solving from a practical perspective</strong>. It has not been disclosed whether Anthropic will release a version combined with its own Vision model in the future, but until the end of 2025, Claude appears to focus on <strong>text and code</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Performance</strong>: Claude 4.1 (based on Opus 4.1) has led the industry by raising <strong>coding accuracy to 74.5%</strong> (SWE-Bench) and strengthening <strong>situation tracking and detailed search capabilities</strong>. In particular, it shows precision in modifying only necessary parts in <strong>large-scale codebases</strong> without making unnecessary changes, with feedback that large enterprise development teams prefer it for practical debugging. Also in <strong>complex data analysis</strong>, the <strong>detail tracking</strong> ability to find key points without missing anything from given documents or tables has improved. According to Anthropic’s internal benchmarks, Claude 4.1 has significantly improved overall capabilities compared to Claude 3.7, and particularly <strong>cheating by finding shortcuts in multi-step reasoning</strong> has decreased by 65%. This means the model has suppressed the tendency to construct answers through shortcuts rather than solving problems sincerely, contributing to providing solutions that users can trust. Claude 4 also shows progress in <strong>model consistency and safety</strong>, showing high compliance rates with Anthropic’s set hunting values (harmful speech suppression, etc.). However, Claude 4.1 also has <strong>knowledge gaps due to limitations in training data</strong> compared to GPT-5 or Gemini 2.5, and is limited in directly handling image or audio information. Nevertheless, it is gaining attention in <strong>enterprise applications</strong> through strengths such as <strong>100k+ context long-term memory, excellent tool integration, and high-quality code output</strong>. In fact, in the second half of 2025, cases of Claude 4 being integrated into major platforms like MS 365 Copilot and Xcode to <strong>increase work productivity</strong> are increasing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessibility and Openness</strong>: Claude 4 can be experienced by general users through <strong><a class="reference external" href="http://claude.ai">claude.ai</a></strong> and is also provided as an API. In particular, Claude 4.1 is deployed on Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud Vertex AI, enabling developers to easily integrate it into their infrastructure. Pricing is set at Opus 4 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(15 input / \)</span>75 output per million tokens, Sonnet 4 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 input / \)</span>15 output, similar to GPT-4 levels. While Anthropic has not disclosed model weights, it has given <strong>some access rights to research partners</strong> to proceed with collaboration. It has also announced a <strong>responsible scaling</strong> policy, transparently disclosing safety checks during model upgrades at regular intervals. These efforts are evaluated as exemplary cases for reliably deploying large models. In summary, Claude 4.1 is a model that continues innovation at the <strong>midpoint between open source and closed models</strong> and greatly contributes to the <strong>practicalization of multimodal AI</strong>.</p></li>

<h2>2. Speech Integration Technology<a class="headerlink" href="#speech-integration-technology" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Second, we examine the latest trends in <strong>the fusion of natural language processing and speech technology</strong>. In multimodal NLP, speech is an important axis, where <strong>speech recognition</strong> (ASR) and <strong>speech synthesis</strong> (TTS) technologies are combined with language models to open new possibilities. In 2025, commercial-grade performance speech models have emerged even in the open source community, and large AI models have also begun integrating speech. Here, we focus on <strong>Voxtral</strong>, a latest speech recognition model, and <strong>Orpheus</strong>, a latest zero-shot TTS model. We examine what improvements each has brought compared to OpenAI’s Whisper (ASR field) and existing TTS, their structure and performance, and open source utilization cases. Additionally, we briefly touch on related trends such as ChatGPT’s speech input/output and Meta’s SeamlessM4T.</p>
<section id="voxtral-next-generation-speech-recognition-and-understanding">
<h3>Voxtral: Next-Generation Speech Recognition and Understanding<a class="headerlink" href="#voxtral-next-generation-speech-recognition-and-understanding" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Voxtral</strong> is a <strong>high-performance open source speech recognition model series</strong> released by <strong>Mistral AI</strong> in 2025. It was developed to surpass open ASR models represented by Whisper-large-v2, and released two versions under Apache 2.0 license: <strong>2.4 billion parameters</strong> (Voxtral Small 2.4B) and <strong>3 billion parameters</strong> (Voxtral Mini 3B). Voxtral’s goal was to create a <strong>speech intelligence platform</strong> that not only has <strong>excellent multilingual speech recognition accuracy</strong> but also <strong>native speech understanding capabilities</strong>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Features Compared to Whisper</strong>: The core that distinguishes Voxtral from existing ASR like Whisper is its <strong>seamless multimodal integrated design</strong>. While Whisper is a pure speech→text converter, Voxtral includes a <strong>language model backbone</strong> (lightweight LLM based on Mistral 7B) internally, enabling <strong>understanding and post-processing of speech input</strong> all at once. For this purpose, an architectural technique that <strong>balances audio embeddings and text embeddings</strong> was introduced. By adding an <strong>audio adapter layer</strong>, the originally vast information-rich speech feature vectors are <strong>downsampled</strong> to <strong>adjust to a length similar to text token sequences</strong>. This enables <strong>balanced learning</strong> when processing speech and text together within a single Transformer, with effects of reducing memory usage and inference latency. In pretraining, <strong>two parallel patterns</strong> were mixed for learning: first, <strong>classical 〈speech → corresponding text〉 pairs</strong> to learn accurate speech-text mapping, and second, <strong>cross-modal continuation</strong> patterns using the strategy of <strong>attaching unrelated text after speech</strong> (e.g., speech A1 followed by completely different text T2, then speech A3 followed by text T4). The latter simulates <strong>natural flows where speech and text alternate in conversation or Q&amp;A situations</strong>, helping the model perform <strong>speech→text→speech</strong> reasoning while maintaining context. Thanks to these architectural/learning improvements, Voxtral shows greatly advanced <strong>multimodal reasoning capabilities</strong> and <strong>language understanding abilities</strong> compared to Whisper. For example, while Whisper can only perform simple “transcription as heard,”, Voxtral can <strong>understand speech to summarize or directly answer questions</strong>. It even supports <strong>function calling through voice</strong>, implementing <strong>voice→action</strong> functionality where it listens to user voice commands and immediately executes API functions (e.g., hearing “turn off the lights” and calling the turn_off(light) function).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance (Compared to Whisper)</strong>: According to Mistral AI’s benchmarks, Voxtral generally outperforms Whisper Large-v2 in <strong>speech recognition accuracy</strong> (WER). For English speech, it recorded SOTA-level <strong>low WER</strong> on <strong>refined reading speech</strong> like Librispeech, and achieved <strong>SOTA WER for major languages</strong> including English, French, German in Mozilla Common Voice multilingual evaluation. Voxtral Small (2.4B) even showed <strong>performance equivalent to ElevenLabs’ commercial model Scribe</strong> while being <strong>less than half the operational cost</strong> as an open source model. It also outperformed Whisper in almost all languages in the FLEURS multilingual evaluation, showing robust results even in <strong>non-European languages like Hindi and Arabic</strong>, demonstrating strengths in <strong>multilingual support</strong>. Beyond simple ASR, Voxtral also self-evaluated <strong>Audio QA</strong> (speech question-answering) and <strong>Audio Captioning</strong> (audio description) tasks, achieving <strong>top-tier scores</strong> comparable to GPT-4 Open-type small models or Google Gemini 2.5. It also achieved SOTA in <strong>speech→speech translation</strong>, showing excellence in applications such as translating English speech to French speech. (Similar to Meta’s SeamlessM4T, this confirms the direction of covering speech, text, and translation with a single model.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Source Usage Cases</strong>: One reason Voxtral is attracting attention is the combination of <strong>“open source + commercial-grade performance”</strong>. Developers can download <strong>Voxtral Small and Mini model weights</strong> through Hugging Face for direct use, or utilize Mistral’s API. The Voxtral API operates as a <strong>Transcribe optimized version</strong>, significantly reducing costs and latency. As an example application, there is a <strong>smart home control demo</strong> released by Baseten. In this demo, the Voxtral Mini model is deployed on a server, and when a user <strong>speaks</strong> “turn on the living room light and set the temperature to 22 degrees,” Voxtral not only <strong>recognizes it as a text command</strong> but also <strong>parses the intent to generate function calls</strong> like turn_on(light) and set_thermostat(22). The backend executes these functions to control a virtual smart home environment and reflects the results in real-time on a 3D virtual house in the web interface. This entire process is accomplished in <strong>a single Voxtral inference step</strong>, and the key is that it is implemented as a <strong>single model</strong> rather than a complex pipeline like Whisper’s “ASR → LLM → tool execution”. These cases demonstrate Voxtral’s potential for <strong>comprehensive speech interfaces</strong>. Voxtral can also be used for various applications such as <strong>real-time meeting recording summarization</strong>, <strong>multilingual call center consultation classification</strong>, and <strong>automated vehicle assistants</strong>. Developers can easily use speech→text functionality by utilizing Transformers’ pipeline(“automatic-speech-recognition”, model=”mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-3B”), and <strong>speech+prompt mixed input</strong> is also supported, such as performing Q&amp;A in “&lt;|user|&gt; … &lt;|assistant|&gt;” format by providing additional prompts. Below is a simple example of loading Voxtral Mini 3B through Hugging Face pipeline to convert speech to text:</p></li>

<p>In the above example, when Korean audio “speech_question.wav” is provided as input, it is converted to Korean text through automatic language detection (Voxtral can <strong>recognize Korean to some extent</strong>, but since it’s not an optimized language, performance may be limited). Thanks to Voxtral’s <strong>32k token context</strong>, it can process up to 30-40 minutes of audio at once, and long recordings can be processed in chunks by adjusting pipeline parameters like chunk_length_s. Additionally, the asr() result provides not only simple text but also information like word-level timestamps, making it useful for future <strong>subtitle generation</strong> or <strong>partial editing</strong>. Voxtral has thus greatly increased accessibility and usability of speech data as a <strong>developer-friendly open model</strong>.</p>

<h3>Orpheus: Evolution of Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech (TTS)<a class="headerlink" href="#orpheus-evolution-of-zero-shot-text-to-speech-tts" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Orpheus</strong> is a <strong>high-quality open source TTS system</strong> announced by <strong>Canopy AI Labs</strong> in late 2024, particularly attracting attention for its <strong>zero-shot speaker cloning</strong> capabilities. Orpheus is equipped with a <strong>Speech-LLM</strong> architecture that applies a <strong>3 billion parameter</strong> language model based on <strong>Llama 2</strong>, which directly generates <strong>human-like natural speech waveforms</strong> when text is input, just as a language model generates sentences. Despite being a lightweight (3B) model, it has excellent audio quality and boasts <strong>low latency</strong> that enables <strong>real-time inference</strong>. Most importantly, with just a <strong>few seconds of speech samples</strong>, it can <strong>immediately mimic new speaker voice characteristics without separate training</strong> (zero-shot), enabling instant TTS with various voices.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Implementation Method</strong>: The internal structure of Orpheus TTS is a <strong>language model</strong> that generates <strong>text→audio token</strong> sequences. Similar to the approach introduced by OpenAI’s VALL-E, it quantizes speech into <strong>digital code tokens</strong> using <strong>Neural Audio Codec</strong> (e.g., Meta EnCodec), and the model autoregressively predicts and generates these token sequences to ultimately synthesize speech waveforms. Orpheus is said to utilize an open source neural codec called <strong>Snack</strong> to establish a token system that represents 24kHz high-quality audio. To apply speaker characteristics in zero-shot, it uses a method of including <strong>reference speech</strong> codec tokens as prompts in the model input. For example, when the model is inferred with input like “&lt;voice_ref&gt;…<text>…”, the output audio tokens generate speech that contains the content of the text while having the voice characteristics of the reference speaker. Thanks to this prompt method, it can mimic <strong>any speaker’s voice</strong> without separate fine-tuning. Additionally, Orpheus introduced <strong>special control tokens</strong> to make emotion and speech style adjustable. For example, inserting <happy> or <sad> tags in the middle of sentences synthesizes with joyful or sad intonation, and tags like <slow>, <chuckle> can express speaking speed or laughter. These features are useful for <strong>emotion-imbued speech synthesis</strong> or <strong>character acting</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Audio Quality and Speaker Preservation Performance</strong>: After its release, Orpheus received community evaluation as <strong>“the highest level of natural synthetic speech currently available”</strong>. The model card claims to implement <strong>“intonation, emotion, and rhythm that are difficult to distinguish from humans”</strong> and asserts it is <strong>superior to commercial closed models</strong>. There are reports that it achieved high naturalness scores in the 4-point range out of 5 in actual users’ Mean Opinion Score evaluations. In terms of <strong>speaker characteristic preservation</strong>, it has been shown to clone voices quite well, maintaining <strong>timbre, tone, and speech habits</strong> even with just about 5 seconds of speech. For example, when a 5-second speech sample of a celebrity is played and then an arbitrary sentence is synthesized, it reproduces their characteristic speech patterns and intonation, creating amazement. Multilingual support is also a strength, covering <strong>over 50 languages</strong> besides English, with natural pronunciation for each language. An interesting point is that with just one speaker’s voice sample, it can <strong>synthesize sentences in other languages with that speaker’s voice</strong>. For example, it has successfully demonstrated cloning a Korean voice actor’s voice to speak English lines in that voice, or conversely, speaking Korean with an English speaker’s voice. This appears to be because Orpheus <strong>separately learned speaker timbre and inter-language pronunciation information through multilingual data</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Real-time and Lightweight Synthesis</strong>: The Orpheus 3B model achieved <strong>streaming synthesis</strong> with <strong>latency of approximately 200ms or less</strong>. This means it can generate and output a sentence in near real-time. It has been shown that <strong>response within 100ms</strong> is also possible when input text is fed in a streaming manner. Since the model size is small at 3 billion parameters, the possibility of lightweight inference on CPU or mobile devices without high-end GPUs is being explored. In fact, attempts are underway to synthesize at 1x speed or faster without GPU through the <strong>Orpheus.cpp</strong> project. Such optimization is useful in <strong>real-time interactive media such as live broadcasting and games</strong>. For example, it can implement features where game characters immediately respond with voice to player actions, or where chat content during live streaming is read aloud in real-time by AI character voices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Application Possibilities</strong>: Orpheus has <strong>very diverse application fields</strong>. First, in the <strong>audiobook/content production</strong> field, it can synthesize different voices for various characters. Without needing one voice actor to produce multiple voices, Orpheus can handle diverse voices and emotional acting to produce audiobooks and dramas. Second, it can be utilized in <strong>educational content</strong> for multilingual voice narration or real-time Q&amp;A guidance. For example, synthesizing English lectures into Korean for provision, or having an AI teacher voice respond when children ask questions in learning apps. Third, in the <strong>marketing and advertising</strong> field, <strong>brand-exclusive voices</strong> can be created and used. Corporate mascot voices can be produced with Orpheus and used consistently in call centers, promotional videos, etc., or emotional AI voices can appeal to listeners in advertisements. Fourth, in <strong>games and virtual worlds</strong>, it can mass-generate <strong>NPC character voices</strong> or convert players’ voice chat. Through real-time synthesis, game characters can speak dialogue and interact, or it can be applied to anonymize players’ voices and deliver them in different voices. Fifth, in the <strong>virtual assistant/AI avatar</strong> field, it provides personalized voices. It can implement assistant voices modeled after users’ family members or celebrities, or avatars that <strong>respond in the user’s own voice</strong>. All these applications are being realized thanks to Orpheus’s <strong>zero-shot voice cloning</strong> and <strong>emotion control</strong> features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Source Usage and Ethics</strong>: Orpheus TTS has its source code (canopyAI/Orpheus-TTS) and training weights publicly available on GitHub, and can be downloaded from Hugging Face after approval. Orpheus demos can also be run on Hugging Face Spaces, and Colab notebooks are provided for easy testing. However, due to the <strong>potential for misuse of speech synthesis</strong>, when using Orpheus, <strong>ethical guidelines</strong> must be strictly followed to prevent <strong>voice theft or fraud</strong>. Model access requires agreement to terms of use, with conditions such as <strong>prohibition of synthesizing others’ voices without consent</strong> clearly stated. This is a measure conscious of the double-edged sword of powerful voice cloning technology. Under these constraints, researchers and developers continue experiments using Orpheus for <strong>speech generation that is difficult to distinguish from real people</strong>, and the community continues to make improvements (e.g., larger model versions, noise processing, etc.).</p></li>

<h2>3. Application Cases and Practice: Multimodal QA Application<a class="headerlink" href="#application-cases-and-practice-multimodal-qa-application" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we cover a <strong>practical application</strong> case that comprehensively utilizes the technologies introduced earlier: a <em>“multimodal QA system that asks questions with voice and responds with images and text”</em>. This is a project presented as Assignment 2 for Week 6, which involves developing a QA application that combines <strong>speech input</strong> and <strong>image+text output</strong>. Users speak questions into a microphone, and the system provides answers to those questions by <strong>explaining in text</strong> while also <strong>generating related images</strong> to show. Through such a system, we can directly implement a pipeline of <strong>speech recognition + language understanding + visual generation</strong>. The practice utilizes Hugging Face’s Transformers and Diffusers libraries, and we will examine the code step by step from simple model loading to input configuration, response generation, and final result visualization.</p>
<section id="application-overview">
<h3>Application Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#application-overview" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The scenario of the <strong>multimodal QA application</strong> is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>User Input</strong>: <strong>Speech Question</strong> (natural language questions input as audio through microphone, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>System Processing Steps</strong>:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Speech Recognition (ASR)</strong>: Convert input speech to text questions. (e.g., utilizing models like Whisper large-v2 or Voxtral)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Natural Language Question Answering (QA)</strong>: Generate text answers to converted text questions using <strong>language models</strong>. (e.g., utilizing knowledge-rich LLMs – Llama-2-7B, GPT-4, Claude, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Image Generation</strong>: Generate or retrieve <strong>images</strong> related to the answer. (e.g., utilizing Text-to-Image generation models like Stable Diffusion)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>System Output</strong>: Present <strong>text answer + generated image</strong> together to the user. (Text is displayed on screen, and TTS for reading aloud is also possible but excluded from this assignment)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The key in this flow is <strong>connecting multiple models/modules as a pipeline</strong>. The output of one module (model) is passed as input to the next module, and finally, different types of outputs must be integrated and provided to the user. Fortunately, using Hugging Face Transformers/Pipelines allows us to implement such complex tasks relatively simply.</p>
<p><strong>Model Selection</strong>: The practice uses relatively lightweight open models. For example: - Speech Recognition: <strong>Whisper small</strong> (openai/whisper-small) or more accurate <strong>Whisper large-v2</strong>, or <strong>Voxtral Mini 3B</strong> (excellent performance but requires HF access approval). Here, we use Whisper large-v2 for convenience. - Natural Language Question Answering: Since multimodal knowledge is needed, it is suitable to use <strong>knowledge-rich LLMs</strong> such as <strong>Llama-2-7B Chat</strong> or <strong>Flan-T5-XL</strong> (both are open models). Here, we use Llama-2-7B Chat model. - Image Generation: Utilize open T2I models like <strong>Stable Diffusion 1.5</strong> (runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) or <strong>Stable Diffusion XL</strong> to generate related images when given text descriptions.</p>
<p>Now let’s examine the actual implementation code with this configuration.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above code processes one cycle of question-answering. Looking at it step by step:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Speech Recognition</strong>: Load the Whisper model with pipeline(“automatic-speech-recognition”). When audio_input (file path or audio data) is input, a result dictionary is returned, and the converted question sentence is in [“text”]. For example, if a user said “What is the highest mountain in the world?”, text similar to “What is the highest mountain in the world?” would be stored in the transcription variable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Question Answering</strong>: Load the LLM with pipeline(“text-generation”). Since we’re using a Chat model here, we simply specified the role in the prompt (User: … n Assistant: …). When qa_pipeline(user_prompt) is called, the model generates an answer. max_length is set appropriately to prevent overly long answers, and parameters like temperature=0.7 can be adjusted if needed. Extracting [“generated_text”] from the output gives us the answer string. For example, if the question was about the world’s highest peak, answer_text would generate something like “Mount Everest is 8848m high and is the highest mountain in the world.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Image Generation</strong>: Load the Stable Diffusion model with pipeline(“text-to-image”). Here, we simply used the <strong>answer text directly as the image prompt</strong>, but in practice, it might be better to input <strong>question content or keywords</strong>. (For example, if the question was “Show me a cat eating fish”, it would be more appropriate to draw the question rather than the answer.) For the practice, we used answer_text for logical simplification. When image_pipeline(answer_text) is called, it generates the specified number of images and returns them as a PIL image object list. We received the first image as image and saved it to a file, and in notebook environments, it can be visualized immediately with display(image).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When the above code is actually run, <strong>text answers are output to the console</strong> and <strong>image files are generated</strong>. For example, if a user asked in speech <em>“How long do sea turtles live?”</em>: - Speech recognition result: “How long do sea turtles live?” - LLM answer: “Sea turtles vary by species, but some species can live over 100 years.” - Image generation: Stable Diffusion will receive the answer text “Sea turtles vary by species, but some species can live over 100 years” and generate an image expressing this (expected to generate an image of sea turtles).</p>
<p>Users can read the <strong>text answer</strong> (“can live over 100 years”) on the result screen and help their understanding by viewing the <strong>provided sea turtle image</strong>. In this way, multimodal QA systems enhance the clarity and interest of answers through <strong>visual assistance</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above pipeline is the most basic form, and there are many areas for improvement for actual application. For example, for image generation prompts, it’s better to process them into <strong>descriptive sentences</strong> rather than using answer sentences as-is (e.g., “A realistic photo of a sea turtle swimming in the ocean.”). Additionally, to compensate for LLM knowledge limitations, <strong>tool usage</strong> or <strong>Wikipedia search</strong> can be inserted in the middle. However, since the goal of this assignment is to implement the <strong>basic flow</strong>, we focus on core pipeline connections here.</p>

<section id="integration-and-execution">
<h3>Integration and Execution<a class="headerlink" href="#integration-and-execution" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In industry, the above process can be integrated into a single <strong>application server</strong> to develop into a form that receives user speech via streaming and returns text/images in real-time. The frontend uploads audio through a microphone, and the backend processes and returns text and images for display. Web demos can be created relatively easily using Hugging Face’s Gradio, etc. The important thing is that through such multimodal pipelines, by practicing <strong>multi-model linkage</strong> that leads from <strong>speech→text→image</strong>, we understand how individual technologies combine to create new user experiences. (Note: As of 2025, ChatGPT and others are showing <strong>end-to-end multimodal UX</strong> that integrates Whisper to receive speech input, uses GPT-4V for image understanding, and DALL-E3 for image generation. The pipeline we created can be said to simulate these latest services using open source tools.)</p>
